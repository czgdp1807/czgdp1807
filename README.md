### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gagandeep, working on Statistics, Algorithms and Software. Take a look at some of my project in the list below.

### Ongoing Projects

- **LFortran** - LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler built on top of LLVM. Working with **[Ondrej Certik](https://github.com/certik)** on adding new features to the compiler like, `select-case`, `pointers`, `arrays` and much more.
- **PyDataStructs** - PyDataStructs, as the name suggests is a python package for data structures and algorithms. Me and my team are working hard to add all the [features we have planned for its first version](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/wiki/Planned-Features-for-v0.0.1).
- **BNN** - BNN is a simple, light weight deep learning framework with a specialisation aimed for Binarized Neural Networks. These days I am [stuck on finding the right algorithm](https://github.com/codezonediitj/BNN/pull/24) for computing derivatives of matrix multiplication operation. Just reach out to me if you have some ideas for this.
- **AdaBoost** - An implementation of AdaBoost algorithm with GPU support using CUDA. Would appreciate some help on this to get it done quickly. :-)

### Completed Projects

- **Enhancement of Statistics Module of SymPy** - This was my Google Summer of Code, 2019 project under the mentorship of **[Francesco Bonazzi](https://github.com/Upabjojr)**. I have written a blog on it, just find it [here](https://czgdp1807.github.io/2019/08/20/z_final_report.html).
- **Optimization of Offloading Scheme Algorithm for Large Number of Tasks in Mobile-Edge Computing** - This was one of my projects for Computer Networking course. The code is available [here](https://github.com/czgdp1807/MECOptimalOffloading).
