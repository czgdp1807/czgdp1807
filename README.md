### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gagandeep, working somehwere in the union of Algorithms, Compilers  and Software domains. Take a look at some of my projects in the list below.

### Ongoing Projects

- **LPython** - LPython is a Python compiler. It is in heavy development, currently in pre-alpha stage and is capable of generating LLVM, C, C++, WASM, x86 code from a given type annotated Python code. I am adding various Python language features in LLVM and C backends such as ``dict``, ``list``, numpy functionality and array programming. Alongside I also work on supporting machine independent code optimisations such as automatic vectorisation of array operations, function inlining, loop unrolling, fused-multiplication addition. Collaborating with **[Ondrej Certik](https://github.com/certik)**.
- **LFortran** - LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler built on top of LLVM. Working with **[Ondrej Certik](https://github.com/certik)** on adding new features to the compiler and making it ready for production use.

### Personal Projects

- **PyDataStructs** - PyDataStructs, as the name suggests is a python package for data structures and algorithms. You can learn more about it on the project's website/documentation https://pydatastructs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

### Completed Projects

- **Enhancement of Statistics Module of SymPy** - This was my Google Summer of Code, 2019 project under the mentorship of **[Francesco Bonazzi](https://github.com/Upabjojr)**. I have written a blog on it, just find it [here](https://czgdp1807.github.io/2019/08/20/z_final_report.html).
- **Probabilistic Trust Intervals for Out of Distribution Detection** - This was a research project I undertook with Prof. Deepak Mishra during my undergraduate studies at IIT Jodhpur. It proposes a technique to distinguish between in and out of distribution inputs by perturbing the weights of a neural network and without using any OOD samples at all. You can read the complete paper at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01336).
- **Optimization of Offloading Scheme Algorithm for Large Number of Tasks in Mobile-Edge Computing** - This was one of my projects for Computer Networking course. The code is available [here](https://github.com/czgdp1807/MECOptimalOffloading).
